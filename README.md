# qr_code_scanner
The QR code scanner project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS involves creating a web application that can scan QR codes using the device's camera. The user can initiate the scanning process by clicking on a button.

To create this project, the first step is to create a simple HTML structure that includes the necessary elements such as the button to initiate the scanning process, a video element to capture the camera feed, and a canvas element to render the QR code.

Overall, this project can be a great way to learn about using JavaScript libraries, accessing device features such as the camera, and working with HTML and CSS to create a functional and visually appealing web application.
